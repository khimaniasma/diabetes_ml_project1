Repo for Diabetes ML Project 1

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a set of diseases related to how the body uses glucose, an essential source of energy for the brain, muscles, and tissues in the body. The disease is metabolic in nature, with two main subtypes – Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). T1D is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system attacks islet cells in the pancreas causing the halt of insulin, a hormone the body uses to allow glucose to enter cells, production in the pancreas. T2D is a common disease where the pancreas still produces insulin, but the body becomes unable to effectively use it for energy. T1D is more prevalent in children and adolescents, while T2D is more common in adults and often the result of poor lifestyle and dietary choices. 

Using UK Biobank Data, we looked at non-genetic features that contribute to both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. These features are crucial in risk preidction, allowing medical professionals to diagnose diabetes early-on therby mitigating complications and improving quality of life.
